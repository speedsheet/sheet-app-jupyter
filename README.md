# Jupyter / Jupyter Lab SpeedSheet

The Jupyter speedsheet covers the installing and running of the Juyter system and Jupyter Labs. The speedsheet is hosted on [speedsheet.io](https://speedsheet.io). This is the raw content for that speedsheet.

# Status

Content: Only The Barest Basics

This covers enough to possibly get an environment installed and running. But it doesn't have much more.

We love speedsheets and we'd love to have them for every language and library out there. But we don't have remotely enough time for all the great docs we want to create. If you would like to help, you can submit updates right here. It would be greatly appreciated! 

And thanks!
